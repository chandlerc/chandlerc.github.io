      <description>Welcome everyone to my first &amp;ldquo;real&amp;rdquo; blog. =]
To set some initial expectations, not all of these posts will be of super high quality published material. Often, I plan to use them for random musings and thoughts which I might have posted somewhere like Twitter, but required a bit more text than fits in a typical tweet.
I hope you all enjoy these. And at least when I have some things to say there will be a place I can post and link to that is easier than tweets.</description>
