# Now let me tell you a story.

???

- graduate student
- start a video game technology company
- needed to be able to talk to investors
- needed to tell *them* a story that would justify investment
  - despite less than 1:20 odds of success
- it didn't work. was a complete failure. probably a good thing
  - didn't know anything
  - terrible idea
- years later, however, i was working at Google on a c++ project
- saw another opportunity, another story
- a story about a uniquely powerful language that was failing its developers
- about a compiler that was holding developers back
- and a tool ecosystem that was non-existent
- and i had the tools to tell this story, and tell it well
- i was able to explain and convince people around me, and then management, and
  beyond that this was worth investing in
- and this is how google started to work on clang, and then c++ more broadly
- i knew what i really wanted
  - to make c++ *better* -- as a language, codebase, ecosystem, and community
- and by telling this story, i was able to help moving google and clang
  and then c++ forward
- this is the amazing opportunity you have every time you give a talk
- you can tell *your* story, and achieve something you *really* want
