So, the reason you're all here! We're going to talk about Undefined Behavior!!!

This seems to be one of the big issues facing C++ right now. It needs its own

int *p = nullptr;

```

???
This is a really simple example of a programming error.
- We could check for this kind of error, but that introduces overhead, and C++
  decided it didn't want to introduce systematic overhead of this kind.
- And yes, there are even platforms or environments where we could efficiently
  check for this error, but even limiting itself to those kinds of platforms
  would be an overhead

In essence, anything we try to do to "handle" this in a standardized,
predictable way will *actively pessimize code* on some platform.

---

template: title-layout

## Programming error, like using an API out of contract

???
These are catching programming errors, not providing error handling! In this
way, they are precisely analogous to API contracts.

template: basic-layout

```
/// \param p must not be null.
void f(int *p);
```
--
```
void f(int *p) [[expects: p != nullptr]];
```

???
Here, you are *required* to call this function with a non-null pointer. It
doesn't throw or otherwise indicate an error if you do this. It's implementation
gets to firmly and completely ignore such a possibility.

---
name: incorrect-programs
template: title-layout

## Programming errors result in *incorrect programs*

???
With this basic framework of contracts in mind, we can start to pin down our
terminology further. Not only are these programming errors, but as a consequence
what we have is an incorrect program.

This actually helps clarify just how high the bar should be for contracts! You
must be comfortable actively labeling any program which fails to satisfy the
contract as fundamentally *incorrect*.

We will return to what it means that these are incorrect programs more later,
but immediately this leads to an important observation:

---
name: incorrect-programs-have-ub
template: title-layout

## We cannot define the behavior of *incorrect programs!*

???
If the program is fundamentally incorrect, I don't know how we can effectively
define its behavior. It will misbehave in some way, but that way can be really
surprising. In fact, it is the surprising and unpredictable way in which
incorrect programs can fail that got us into this mess with nasal demons.

```
struct Node {
  // ...

  std::vector<Node *> outgoing_edges;
};

/// Finds a sink in the directed graph containing the node.
///
/// Requires that the graph containing the node is acyclic.
Node &findSink(Node &n);
```

???
Imagine you have a routine that searches a directed acyclic graph structure for
a particular node. If you give it a directed graph with a cycle, violating this
contract, the algorithm might well infinitely loop.

Checking this requires cycle detection which has really significant cost and
might not be reasonable at all

Under some performance circumstances might be able to to check this, but not
always.

That's OK because it is simply a *programming error* to call this routine
out-of-contract

A user of some library might insist that the library at least have a mode to
check this though!

But what I want to focus on, is could we define the behavior here for a cyclic
graph? Just how could it go wrong?

---
name: api-acyclic-example-impl1
template: basic-layout

```
Node &findSink(Node &n) {
  if (n.outgoing_edges.empty())
    return n;

  // Don't need any particular sink, just recurse to find the first one
  // encountered.
  return findSink(*n.outgoing_edges.front());
}
```

???
Ok, so what can go wrong with this? Let's look at the first attempt to implement
the routine.

---
name: api-acyclic-example-impl2
template: basic-layout

```
Node &findSink(Node &start_node) {
  Node *n = &start_node;

  // Walk any outgoing edge until we encounter a sink.
  while (!n.outgoing_edges.empty())
    n = n.outgoing_edges.front();

  return *n;
}
```

## So can we eliminate *all* UB?

???
Not a really useful question... Even if every usage of every feature was
in-contract that wouldn't be enough. You'd need every API to have a wide
contract and all logic to not have bugs. You'd also need a bug-free compiler.

The real question here is about whether the contracts on the language features
are wide or narrow.

template: title-layout

## Can we make every language feature have a wide contract?

---
name: eliminate-all-ub-nope
template: title-layout

## No. (grumpy cat)

???
Why not? Because this kind of extreme direction seems infeasible without
comprimising fundamental aspects of C++.

Let's look at just one hard example: how do we define all behavior in the
presence of data races? This has been a serious challenge for Java for over 20
years. And almost any solution employed by C++ would have a very significant
performance penalty for a large number of users.

But this extreme position also isn't really necessary.

1. Checking programs for whether they are correct

---
name: constrain-narrow-contracts
template: title-layout

# But when is it appropriate to have a narrow contract?

???
Trying to constrain the behavior of programs that are out-of-contract is
interesting for security folks and for debugging and other things. But that
isn't what IMO impacts programmers the most long term.

The real question for programmers is when is it reasonable for the language to
provide them a narrow contract instead of a wide contract?

---

## But narrow contracts impose a burden on the programmer

This is a complex tradeoff question. It would be useful to outline some
principled constraints that we should use to pin down when a language level
contract should be narrow.

---
name: narrow-contract-principles
template: basic-layout

### Principles for narrow language contracts

???
The checking may be very expensive, but it has to be possible. We've managed to
do this for one of the most challenging areas: data races.

And just because it is primarily checked at runtime doesn't mean it shouldn't be
checked at every opportunity at every other layer of the development stack from
compile time warnings through static analysis tools.

This is a tradeoff space and so there must be a value proposition attached.

...

While this point is important it is often misunderstood. The code has to
otherwise work correctly and as intended. If the pervasive code outside the
narrow contract is already buggy or doesn't work as intended, then keeping it
working doesn't actually have any value and so the other factors should
dominate.

--
1. Checkable (probabilistically) at runtime

--
1. Provide significant value: bug finding, simplification, and/or optimization

--
1. Easily explained and taught to programmers

--
1. Not widely violated by existing code that works correctly and as intended

???
Making signed integers have a wide contract may not be a win. Remember, narrow
contracts often make it easier to find bugs.

We can look at code dealing with these kinds of boundary conditions with
unsigned integers which have a wide contract to see how it goes. For example
here is code found in the copy of GCC in SPEC CINT2000 by researchers looking
at integer overflow bugs.

First, consider this code after the sizeof operators are resolved and the
promotion rules are applied: 16 + ((unsigned)(n-1)) * ((unsigned)8). When n =
0, we immediately see the code casting âˆ’1 to unsigned, which evaluates to
UINT_MAX, or 2^32 âˆ’ 1. The result is then multiplied by eight, which overflows
with a result of 2^32 âˆ’ 8. Finally, the addition is evaluated, which produces
the final result of 8 after wrapping around again. Although the overflow itself
is benign, its consequences are unfortunate. Only eight bytes are allocated but
the rtvec_def structure is 16 bytes. Any attempt to copy it by value will
result in a memory safety error, perhaps corrupting the heap

Now consider how much simpler it would be to reason about these bugs with
signed integer arithmetic and assertions or compiler synthesized overflow
checking.

When a narrow contract diverges from widespread, reasonable, and portable
expectations and implementations. Even more so when they are in fact not
checked at any point. These contracts become de facto wide.
